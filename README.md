# Unified percolation scenario for the alpha and beta processes in simple glass formers

## code

​	The double percolation strategy is implemented by 'DMS_mobile' and 'DMS_immobile' in the 'code/percolation' file. Please place it in a subdirectory of the dump file generated by the DMS simulation.

Workflows:

* Generating MD-DMS Scripts  --  code/DMS/gendms.lmp

* Run DMS -- LAMMPS

* Fitting Stress -- code/DMS/fitdms.py

* Double-percolation Strategy (LC and SLC) -- code/percolation/DMS\_\*/cluster\_all\_\*.py

* Distribution of Clusters (Radius of gyration, correlation length, etc.) -- code/percolation/DMS\_\*/start_sfp.py

  

## data

​	The data file contains the raw data from the MD-DMS of all models. The code is preserved here, so you can try to run it.
